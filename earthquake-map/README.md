## Build Setup

``` bash
#Go to the folder with project and run : 

# install dependencies
npm install

#After this step your browser will launch on : localhost:8080, if not please navigate there .

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

PLEASE NOTE : 

1.If you do not have dependencies installed you will have to install them yourself.

2.The google maps team has made using google api keys mandatory and is a charged service, since this project was built just for demonstration purposes, I will not insert one. 
 The API will respond with the message :

  This page can't load Google Maps correctly.
    Do you own this website?

This is a normal response. The map will work and the pins will be there!
