PLEASE NOTE : The google maps team has made using google api keys mandatory and is charged service, since i do not plan to provide a public access to this project i will not insert one. 
 The API will respond with the message :

  This page can't load Google Maps correctly.
    Do you own this website?

This is a normal response. The map will work and the pins will be there.
