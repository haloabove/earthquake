# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080

PLEASE NOTE : 

1.If you do not have dependencies installed you will have to install them yourself.

2.The google maps team has made using google api keys mandatory and is a charged service, since i do not plan to provide a public access to this project i will not insert one. 
 The API will respond with the message :

  This page can't load Google Maps correctly.
    Do you own this website?

This is a normal response. The map will work and the pins will be there!
